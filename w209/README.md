# W209 - Visualizing and Communicating Data
====

This course taught the basic theory of design, good habits in data visualization, and reinforced writing for technical, academic and layman audiences. We learned that D3 is a javascript library for creating interactive charts and had some optional assignments to use it. 

I have one semi-working example using D3 available at https://raybuhr.github.io/... semi-working because when the sort values box is checked/unchecked the x-axis doesn't move with it so you don't know what days are which.
