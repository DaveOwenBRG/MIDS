DATASCI W210 - Synthetic Capstone
===================================

Course Description
-------------------

In the capstone class, students combine technical, analytic, interpretive, and social dimensions to design
and execute a full data science project, developing their skills as data scientists with a focus on realworld
applications and situations. The final project provides an opportunity to integrate all of the core
skills and concepts learned throughout the program and prepares students for long-term professional
success in the field. It provides experience in formulating and carrying out a sustained, coherent, and
impactful course of work resulting in a tangible data science project using real-world data. Students are
evaluated on their ability to collaboratively develop and communicate their work in both written and
oral form. The capstone is completed as a group project, and each project will focus on open, preexisting,
secondary data. There are relevant readings and case discussions throughout. We provide
many real-world examples and perspectives, including through panel discussions with leading data
science experts and practitioners.

Course Summary
---------------

This course has three main goals:

1. Practice using data science to drive significant impact by solving challenging, valuable problems
(i.e., by creating new data-driven capabilities or by influencing decisions that can significantly
improve mission-critical results)
2. Reinforce critical problem-solving, communication, influencing, and management skills
3. Engage in a process of teamwork, feedback, and iteration that mirrors the challenges and
opportunities of applying data science in a realistic organizational setting

We begin by covering fundamentals for effective execution, including a review of the “top-management
perspective,” problem structuring, selecting tools/approaches, work planning, and managing ethical and
legal considerations. We then broaden our focus to leading others, managing teams,
communication/presentation fundamentals, influencing in organizations, and leveraging data
visualization. We conclude with advanced topics like institutionalizing data-driven decision-making,
building products, and perspectives on the future of data science.

**Prerequisites:** 
Students must have completed (or are completing during the same semester) all core
courses.

Course Assignments and Final Exam
-----------------------------------

The primary assignments for this course are three group presentations to the class along with a final
web-based deliverable for the group project. In addition to these assignments, students are evaluated
based on their participation in class discussions, and by their group-mates based on contributions to the
group.

- 55% - Participation - class discussions and group project participation
- 25% - In-class presentations - instructor evaluation and peer feedback on presentations
- 20% - Web-based final deliverable

Course Data Sets, Software, and Tools
--------------------------------------

This course allows students wide discretion for selecting problems, analyses, data sets, software, and
tools for use on their group projects.

Students may select any problem and approach that meets their interests, affords opportunities for truly
impactful results, and is feasible within the timeframe of this course. Students may select any open data
sets (publically available, unrestricted) that suit their focal problem/analysis, and may use any software
or tools that are appropriate for meeting their goals. Students must present and defend their choices
across these dimensions throughout the course.

Students are required to thoroughly document their analyses. They are also strongly encouraged to
build an end-to-end analysis pipeline covering data sourcing, cleaning/preparation, transformation,
processing, visualization, interpretation, etc.
