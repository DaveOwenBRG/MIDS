    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "**a. Why doesn't nearest neighbors work well for this problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearest neighbor classifiers do not work well when there are too many features. 'Too many' is of course vague, but the idea is that the more features involved, the farther away the nearest neighbor will be and thus the model will have a really hard time finding features useful to predict our desired output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Any ideas why logistic regression doesn't work as well as Naive Bayes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression does not work as well in this situation because there are many more features than training examples, thus logistic regression overfit the model because it incorporated correlations between the features into the prediction. Naive Bayes classifier assumes independence between features and thus does not have the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Logistic regression estimates a weight vector for each class, which you can access with the coef\\_ attribute. Output the sum of the squared weight values for each class for each setting of the C parameter. Briefly explain the relationship between the sum and the value of C.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Output of sum of the squared weights for each class for each setting of C parameter are listed above. The value of C is the inverse of regularization strength, so smaller values represent stronger regularization. Regularization is the concept of penalizing larger parameter values to offset overfitting of the data. As C gets larger in value, the size of the parameters of the logistic regression model will increase in magnitude to adjust to the training data. Smaller values of C correspond with smaller magnitude of errors. "

That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",
