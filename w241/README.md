# W241 - Field Experiments
=====

This course teaches the importance of causality when trying understand relationships in data, as well as teaches about experimental design in business and social science environments. All problem sets involved a lot of statistics, mostly using regression, to interpret the results of evidence from controlled trial experiments. R was the programming language used to teach the course and complete the problem sets in.
