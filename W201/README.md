# W201 - Research Design and Application for Data and Analysis

Technically, we covered research design for one week. Really this course covered a lot of the social skills needed for Data Science, as well as topics in Behavioral Economics, Psychology, Business, Information Theory and others. 

The course required regular short 1-2 page writing assignments and/or presentations. Some were individual and some group based. 

The course also had a final group project that involved planning a Data Science project, but not actually carrying it out.
