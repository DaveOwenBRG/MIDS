# W241 - Field Experiments
=====

This course teaches the importance of causality when trying understand relationships in data, as well as teaches about experimental design in business and social science environments. All problem sets involved a lot of statistics, mostly using regression, to interpret the results of evidence from controlled trial experiments. R was the programming language used to teach the course and complete the problem sets in.

### Directory Orginization

*Note:*

This repo contains work done by myself during the summer of 2015. I did it on Windows 10, which I no longer use. I added most of the content in Sept. 2017, so I made a best effort to organize the content into relevant problem sets and final project, but I do not remember which source data files are used in which respective problem set so they are all in the base directory (unless obviously belonging to a specifc problem set). The final project contains original research perform by myself and my teammates.
