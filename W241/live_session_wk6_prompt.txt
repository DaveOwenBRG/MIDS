Practicing regression with the Colin/José example from FE (p. 304-307)

Note that equation [9.16] only gives estimated coefficients, and lacks estimates of those coefficients’ standard errors.  
Let’s fix this by doing the regression ourselves.

The full dataset is described completely in Table 9.1.  
You will have to figure out how to create a version of this dataset for which you can run the regression.  

What will that look like?  How many rows and columns?
Once you have created the data file, run the regression in Equation 9.16.   
Present the results with standard errors in parentheses.
Which of the coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level, and which are not?
How do you interpret the magnitudes of the significant coefficients?
Now that you’ve practiced doing a simple regression, it’s a really good thing to get in the habit of using 
heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors.  
Re-run your regression model with robust standard errors, and re-answer the previous problems.
