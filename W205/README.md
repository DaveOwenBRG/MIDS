# W205 - Storing and Retrieving Data

This course was in the middle of identity crisis when I took it. Asynchronous lectures were on the theory of information and history of information science. Live sessions were practical applications of data collection, storage and retrieval systems using python. Topics covered included web scraping, SQL, NoSQL and NewSQL databases, MapReduce framework, Spark distributed processing and Natural Language Processing. Thus, I like to think of this class as *Intro to Data Engineering for Data Scientists*.
